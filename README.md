# How to setup

```bash
npm install # Will install every needed package for each of the sub project in client and server directories
```
```bash
npm dev
# In the root:
#  - will start both the client and the server in dev mode
#
# In client/server:
#  - will start client/server in dev mode
```

The root directory contains barely anything except concurrently to start the server and the client in parallele.
